During the days 344L is using the NMR, the students will prepare their unknowns in CDCl3 and you will help them run their samples. If you are going to give an additional explanation of the NMR, I recommend doing it right after the professor's prelab so you only have to give the explanation once (how the superconduncting magnet works, why we use deuterium, how it looks for the deuterium to know what the magnetic field strength is, how it uses an additional magnetic field to minimize drift of the main field B0, what gradient shimming is).

The c13 experiments take too long, so they have been run before hand in 2014. The PDF lists the unknown numbers with the spectra. Print out several of these since there is only one copy of each compound included in this packet, and a compound may appear up to 4 times throughout various sections. Anyhow, they'll tell you the sample number they have, and you'll look up what compound that is using the current unknown list. Once you have the name, you go to the 2014 c13 packet and find the 2014 unknown number associated with that name, and hand them the 'unknown' c13 spectra. I usually scribble out the out-dated 2014 unknown numbers so there's no confusion for the student.
